# flink-sql-demo-redpanda
End-to-End Demo with Flink, Redpanda, MySQL, Elastic, and Kibana

Based on https://github.com/wuchong/flink-sql-demo.

This modifies the original project to use Redpanda in place of Kafka.
Apart from this detail, the instructions as per the blog
https://flink.apache.org/2020/07/28/flink-sql-demo-building-e2e-streaming-application.html
should work with no modifications.
