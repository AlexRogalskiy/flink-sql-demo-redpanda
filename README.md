# flink-sql-demo-redpanda
End-to-End Demo with Flink, Redpanda, MySQL, Elastic, and Kibana

Based on https://github.com/wuchong/flink-sql-demo.

This modifies the original project to use Redpanda in place of Kafka.
Apart from this detail, the instructions as per the blog
http://wuchong.me/blog/2020/02/25/demo-building-real-time-application-with-flink-sql/
should work with no modifications.
